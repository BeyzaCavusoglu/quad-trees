I implement a slightly more complex version of binary search trees which are quad trees. Remember that binary search trees typically work on one dimensional key spaces.
Quad trees let us search on two-dimensional spaces and extensions to higher dimensional spaces should be obvious. These kind of trees are very useful in many graphics applications and in computer aided design tools for automated design of VLSI (very large scale integration) circuits. Instead of each node having at most 2 children, in such trees, nodes have at most 4 children. For reasons that will be clear in a moment, I will call these children as TopLeft, TopRight, BottomLeft and BottomRight.

The detailed explanation added in the file "quad-trees.dvi" into this repository.
